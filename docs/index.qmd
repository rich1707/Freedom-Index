# Introduction

The data we'll be using for the exercise comes from the *Tidy Tuesday* repository on [Github](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) and deals with political rights and civil liberties in each of the world's countries. The dataset is available [here.](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-02-22/readme.md)

First let's load the packages we'll be using:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(janitor)
library(scales)
library(WDI)
library(countrycode)
library(vip)
```

I've already downloaded the dataset to my local machine, so we can now read in the data:

```{r}
freedom_data <- read_csv("freedom_data.csv")
```

We can get an idea of the data with which we'll be dealing by using the `glimpse()` function:

```{r}
glimpse(freedom_data)
```

# Data Cleaning

Are there any missing values?

```{r}
freedom_data |> 
   summarise(across(everything(), \(x) sum(is.na(x)))) |> 
   pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "vars", values_to = "totals") |> 
   arrange(vars)
```

We can use the `janitor` package to help clean up the variable names, which aren't particularly user friendly as things stand. We can also clean up one of the values of the `country` feature.

```{r}
freedom_data <- freedom_data |> 
   clean_names() |> 
   rename(civil_liberties = cl, political_rights = pr) |> 
   mutate(country = if_else(country == "CÃƒÂ´te dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ivoire", "Ivory Coast", country))
```

Thankfully this is all the data-cleaning we need to do.

# Exploratory Analysis

Start with a basic plot showing the situation by region:

```{r}
freedom_data |> 
   filter(year == 2020) |> 
   group_by(region_name) |> 
   summarise(
      total_countries = n(),
      total_free = sum(status == "F"),
      total_oppressed = total_countries-total_free,
      percentages = total_free/total_countries,
      .groups = "drop"
   ) |> 
   mutate(
      region_name = factor(
         region_name, 
         levels = c("Asia", "Africa", "Americas", "Europe", "Oceania")
      )
   ) |> 
   arrange(desc(percentages)) |> 
   ggplot(aes(x = region_name, y = percentages)) +
   geom_point(colour = "#34495E", size = 3.5) +
   geom_segment(
      aes(x = region_name, xend = region_name, y = 0, yend = percentages),
      colour = "#34495E",
      linewidth = 1.5
   ) +
   coord_flip() +
   scale_y_continuous(
      breaks = c(0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), 
      limits = c(0, 1), 
      labels = percent
   ) +
   labs(
      x = NULL,
      y = NULL,
      title = "Percentage of free countries by region",
      subtitle = 
         "Showing the different levels of freedom across continents for the year 2020"
   ) +
   theme_light() +
   theme(
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10, face = "italic")
   )
   
```

Clearly the situation is very bad indeed in Asia and Africa. As these regions are less economically developed than the rest, perhaps it would be worthwhile to build a plot based on the `is_ldc` (least developed country) feature:

```{r}
freedom_data |> 
   group_by(year, is_ldc) |> 
   mutate(
      free = sum(status == "F"),
      part_free = sum(status == "PF"),
      not_free = sum(status == "NF")
   ) |> 
   ungroup() |> 
   select(year, is_ldc, contains("free")) |> 
   distinct() |>
   group_by(year, is_ldc) |> 
   mutate(totals = free + part_free + not_free) |> 
   ungroup() |>
   mutate(
      free_percent = free / totals,
      part_free_percent = part_free / totals,
      not_free_percent = not_free / totals
   ) |>
   select(year, is_ldc, contains("percent")) |>
   pivot_longer(
      cols = contains("percent"),
      names_to = "names",
      values_to = "values"
   ) |>
   mutate(is_ldc = if_else(is_ldc == 1, "Least Developed", "Developed")) |> 
   ggplot(aes(x = year, y = values, colour = names)) +
   geom_line(size = 2, alpha = 0.9) +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1)) +
   scale_color_manual(
      values = c("#F39C12", "#bab86c", "#179FA3"),
      labels = c("Free", "Partly Free", "Not Free")
   ) +
   labs(
      x = NULL, 
      y = NULL,
      title = "Percentage of free countries by developed status",
      subtitle = "Showing that economic development is highly correlated with freedom"
   ) +
   theme_light() +
   facet_wrap(~is_ldc) +
   theme(
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = "italic"),
      legend.text = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#3b4d5b"),
      strip.text = element_text(colour= "#f8f8f2"),
      legend.title = element_blank(),
      legend.key.width = unit(1.5, "cm"),
      legend.position = "bottom"
   ) 
```

The difference between the developed and least-developed world is striking. We can also quantify this difference with a Chi_squared test of independence using the `infer` package bundled with `tidymodels`:

```{r}
diff_hat <- freedom_data |> 
   mutate(is_ldc = if_else(is_ldc == 1, "Least Developed", "Developed")) |> 
   specify(status ~ is_ldc) |> 
   calculate(stat = "Chisq")

freedom_data |> 
   mutate(is_ldc = if_else(is_ldc == 1, "Least Developed", "Developed")) |> 
   specify(status ~ is_ldc) |> 
   assume(distribution = "Chisq") |> 
   get_p_value(obs_stat = diff_hat, direction = "two-sided")
```

The `p_value` is close to zero, so we can conclude that `status` and `is_ldc` are not independent.

As always, we should not jump to the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between the two. Besides, even if we do believe that the two are in a causal relationship, it is difficult to say in which direction this relationship runs. Are countries under-developed because they are not free, or are they not free because they ar under-developed? There's nothing in our data that could answer this question.

However, we can be more confident in assessing the direction in which our freedoms and civil liberties are heading. Consider the following plot:

```{r}
freedom_data |> 
   filter(region_name == "Europe") |> 
   mutate(
      percent_pr = political_rights / 7, # here the ratings are from 1 to 7
      percent_cl = civil_liberties / 7
   ) |> 
   group_by(year, region_name) |> 
   summarise(
      pr_x_year = 1 - mean(percent_pr),
      cl_x_year = 1 - mean(percent_cl),
      .groups = "drop"
   ) |> 
   pivot_longer(
      cols = pr_x_year:cl_x_year,
      names_to = "names",
      values_to = "values"
   ) |> 
   ggplot(aes(x = year, y = values, colour = names)) + 
   geom_line(linewidth = 2, alpha = 0.85) + 
   theme_light() + 
   scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1)) + 
   scale_color_manual(
      values = c("#179FA3", "#F39C12"),
      labels = c("Civil Liberties", "Political Rights"),
      guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
   ) + 
   labs(
      x = NULL, 
      y = NULL,
      title = "The evolution of Civil Liberties and Political Rights of countries in Europe",
      subtitle = "Showing the average points awarded as a percentage of the maximum possible"
   ) + 
   theme(
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 13, face = "bold"),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"),
      legend.text = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      legend.title = element_blank(),
      legend.position = "bottom"
   )
```

Here we can see that Europe is going backwards in terms of freedoms, a trend which is present in all regions except Oceania:

```{r}
freedom_data |> 
   filter(region_name != "Europe") |> 
   mutate(region_name = factor(
      region_name, 
      levels = c("Asia", "Africa", "Oceania", "Americas")
   )) |> 
   mutate(
      percent_pr = political_rights / 7,
      percent_cl = civil_liberties / 7
   ) |> 
   group_by(year, region_name) |> 
   summarise(
      pr_x_year = 1 - mean(percent_pr),
      cl_x_year = 1 - mean(percent_cl),
      .groups = "drop"
   ) |> 
   pivot_longer(
      cols = pr_x_year:cl_x_year,
      names_to = "names",
      values_to = "values"
   ) |>
   ggplot(aes(x = year, y = values, colour = names)) + 
   geom_line(linewidth = 1.75, alpha = 0.85) + 
   theme_light() + 
   scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(accuracy = 1)) + 
   scale_color_manual(
      values = c("#179FA3", "#F39C12"),
      labels = c("Civil Liberties", "Political Rights"),
      guide = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)
   ) + 
   labs(
      x = NULL, 
      y = NULL,
      title = 
         "The evolution of Civil Liberties and Political Rights of countries outside Europe",
      subtitle = 
         "Showing the average points awarded as a percentage of the maximum possible"
   ) + 
   facet_wrap(~region_name, scales = "free") + 
   theme(
      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      strip.text.x = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 12, face = "bold"),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"),
      legend.text = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#3b4d5b"),
      strip.text = element_text(colour= "#f8f8f2"),
      legend.title = element_blank(),
      legend.position = "bottom"
   )
```

An interesting feature of the above graphs, again with the possible exception of Oceania, is that the level of `political_rights` and `civil_liberties` tend to be closely correlated. We can put a number to this relationship by once again using the `infer` package:

```{r}
freedom_data |> 
   specify(political_rights ~ civil_liberties) |> 
   calculate(stat = "correlation") |> 
   pull(stat)
```

As we can see, the correlation is very strong.

# Reading in extra data

We have seen that the freedoms enjoyed by a given country are correlated with: (1) where the country is located in terms of region; and (2) whether the country is developed or not. These two fact suggest a relationship between economic wealth and political freedom.

As such, lets read in some new data. The `wdi` package---which I learned about from David Robinson's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOzUHk3aaBw) on the topic of this very dataset ---gives us access to GDP data for each country over the entire time period in which we are interested.

```{r}
world_bank_data <- WDI(indicator = "NY.GDP.PCAP.CD", extra = TRUE)
```

We need to join the above to our `freedom_data` dataset. Does the `country` column in the two datasets line up?

```{r}
freedom_data |> 
   anti_join(world_bank_data, by = "country") |> 
   distinct(country)
```

Unfortunately there are differences between the datasets, so it won't be possible to join them without a little more work. Thankfully we can use the `countrycode()` function (found in the `countrycode`package) to save us a lot of data-wrangling work:

```{r}
freedom_data <- freedom_data |> 
   mutate(iso2c = countrycode(country, "country.name", "iso2c"))
```

Lets tidy up our `world_bank_data` before we `join` the two datasets:

```{r}
world_bank_data <- world_bank_data |> 
   rename(gdp = NY.GDP.PCAP.CD) |> 
   filter(year >= 1995, year <= 2020) |> 
   select(iso2c, year, gdp, income)
```

Both datasets are now ready for `left_join()`:

```{r}
freedom_data <- freedom_data |> 
   left_join(world_bank_data, by = c("iso2c", "year")) |> 
   drop_na()
```

# Exploring our new dataset

We should first `glimpse()` our data:

```{r}
glimpse(freedom_data)
```

What counts as a high-income country? We can answer this by taking the average of each `income` group:

```{r}
freedom_data |> 
   filter(year == 2020) |> 
   mutate(income = case_when(
      income == "Lower middle income" ~ "Lower middle",
      income == "Upper middle income" ~ "Upper middle",
      TRUE ~ as.character(income)
   )) |> 
   mutate(income = fct_reorder(income, gdp, .desc = FALSE)) |> 
   group_by(income) |> 
   summarise(
      min_gdp = min(gdp),
      mean_gdp = mean(gdp),
      max_gdp = max(gdp),
      .groups = "drop"
   ) |> 
   pivot_longer(
      cols = ends_with("_gdp"),
      names_to = "names",
      values_to = "values"
   ) |> 
   mutate(names = factor(
      names, 
      levels = c("min_gdp", "mean_gdp", "max_gdp")
   )) |> 
   ggplot(aes(x = income, y = values, fill = names)) + 
   geom_col(position = "dodge2", alpha = 0.85, width = .45) +
   theme_light() + 
   scale_fill_manual(
      values = c("#F39C12", "#bab86c", "#179FA3"),
      labels = c("Minimum GDP of group", "Average GDP of group", "Maximum GDP of group")
   ) +
    labs(
      x = NULL, 
      y = NULL,
      title = "The differences in income (largely regional)",
      subtitle = 
         "Showing the minimum, the mean, and the maximum for countries in each income bracket"
   ) +
   scale_y_continuous(labels = label_dollar()) +
   theme(
      axis.text.x = element_blank(),
      axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = "bold"),
      plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 11, face = "italic"),
      strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#3b4d5b"),
      strip.text = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold", colour= "#f8f8f2"), #005300
      legend.title = element_blank(),
      legend.text = element_text(size = 11, face = "bold"),
      legend.position = "bottom"
   ) +
   facet_wrap(~income, scales = "free")
   
```

The inequalities are very stark. It is obvious that significant differences exist in GPD within the group---for example, the high income group has a massive disparity between the minimum GPD and the maximum. However, the differences between the groups are greater still, with people in the lower groups existing in desperate poverty.

# A simple model

We have seen that the `region_name`, the level of `gdp` and the `is_ldc` feature are all indicative of the level of freedom a country enjoys (or not). Lets build a simple model seeing how much of our data these features can explain.

First we do some data-wrangling. We limit ourselves to 2020 and make a new variable, `is_free`, which we will attempt to `predict()`. Our indicator variables will be the features discussed above:

```{r}
model_data <- freedom_data |> 
   filter(year == 2020) |> 
   mutate(is_free = if_else(status == "F", "free", "not_free")) |>
   select(is_free, region_name, gdp, is_ldc)
```

We set a seed so our results are reproducible:

```{r}
set.seed(2022)
```

We divide our data into training and test splits. We won't have any need for cross-validation folds, as a simple algorithm should suffice here.

```{r}
freedom_split <- initial_split(model_data, prop = 0.75, strata = region_name)

freedom_training <- training(freedom_split)

freedom_testing <- testing(freedom_split)
```

We create a simple `recipe()` in which we do the pre-processing of our data:

```{r}
freedom_recipe <- model_data |> 
   recipe(is_free ~ gdp + region_name + is_ldc) |> 
   step_string2factor(is_free, skip = TRUE) |> 
   step_string2factor(all_nominal_predictors()) |> 
   step_normalize(gdp)
```

We then create our `model_spec()`. Here we are building a simple `logistic_reg()` model, which is possible as we have reduced our outcome variable to two levels. Although we have more powerful algorithms available than `glm`, in this very small dataset a simple algorithm should perform reasonably well.

```{r}
freedom_spec <- logistic_reg() |> 
   set_engine("glm") |> 
   set_mode("classification")
```

We put both the `recipe()` and the `model_spec` into a `workflow()` object:

```{r}
freedom_workflow <- workflow() |> 
   add_model(freedom_spec) |> 
   add_recipe(freedom_recipe)
```

And finally we `fit()` our model:

```{r}
freedom_model <- fit(freedom_workflow, data = freedom_training)
```

Now we need to see how well it performed.

# Evaluation

First lets see which variables were considered to be most important:

```{r}
freedom_model |> 
   extract_fit_engine() |> 
   vi() |> 
   mutate(Variable = fct_reorder(Variable, Importance)) |> 
   ggplot(aes(x = Variable, y = Importance)) + 
   geom_point(size = 3, colour = "#34495E", alpha = 0.85) + 
   geom_segment(
      aes(x = Variable, xend = Variable, y = 0, yend = Importance), 
      colour = "#34495E",
      alpha = 0.65,
      linewidth = 1.5
   ) +
   theme_light() + 
   labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, 
        title = "Showing variable importance for each feature") + 
   theme(
      axis.text.x = element_text(face = "bold"),
      axis.text.y = element_text(face = "bold"),
      plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 14),
   ) + 
   coord_flip()
```

It is no surprise to see `gdp` topping the list. But how well does our model do on unseen data?

```{r}
freedom_preds <- predict(freedom_model, new_data = freedom_testing)
```

Lets use `bind_cols()` to add predictions to the `validation_data` dataset:

```{r}
freedom_preds <- freedom_testing |> 
   select(is_free) |> 
   mutate(is_free = as.factor(is_free)) |> 
   bind_cols(freedom_preds)
```

We can now test our model using the `accuracy()` function from the `yardstick` package:

```{r}
freedom_preds |> 
   accuracy(is_free, .pred_class)
```

This seems to be a reasonable level of accuracy. It is surprising, at least to me, how well we can predict freedom from the group of features we selected as our indicator variables. No doubt we could do a lot better by incorporating other, more nuanced geopolitical factors; but the three features we have used - namely `region_name`, `gdp` and `is_ldc`- are capable of doing most of the heavy lifting unaided.
